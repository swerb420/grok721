This repository contains example data pipeline scripts. The `main.py` script
provides a simplified workflow that ingests gas prices and tweets. The
`extra_pipeline.py` module expands this with additional ingestion functions.

The `advanced_pipeline.py` and `mega_pipeline.py` files provide more
comprehensive examples. They demonstrate how to initialise a
comprehensive SQLite database and perform concurrent ingestion from many
data sources. These scripts are intended as reference implementations
rather than runnable programs out of the box.
